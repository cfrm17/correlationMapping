# correlationMapping
A simplified Loss Ratio method (named “Maturity Loss Ratio”) is adopted in the model.  The detachment points of the bespoke base tranche are solved such that, given the same correlation value, the normalized expected losses of the bespoke tranche meet with that of the standard index base tranches.
